# net-integrationTests
Integration tests in .NET test how components work together by creating an in-memory instance of the application using tools like `WebApplicationFactory`. This allows you to inject and test the `Program.cs` class and other dependencies, ensuring end-to-end functionality without needing to deploy the application.
